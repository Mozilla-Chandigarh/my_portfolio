# How to get your own portfolio website?
## Git Commands
Here are the commands you will need to get the work done.
## Fork
The very first step is to fork the  repository from GitHub.(The button appears at right-top corner)

## Get the code
Git clone 'URL' - copy all the code  in the current repo you forked

## Add and Commit Changes
Make changes and 'git add . 'them  followed by git commit -m"your message"

## Push Changes
Changes have been made, push  them git push origin "branch"


## Thing to Change
You need to change the photograph that appears on left Navbar -> Just paste your photograph(.jpg) in <b>sources</b> folder of this repository and rename it to my_img
Now to have the website for a male person there are svg's provided for both. Check it in the folder and rename the <b>src</b> accordingly.

After this, Sky is the limit! play with it and make it awesome!!! Change the text, fill the website with correct information. Share the link with us so that we know how creative you are.
